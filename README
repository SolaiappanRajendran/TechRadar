Make your own Technology Radar.

Inspired by the ThoughtWorks Tech Radar: http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/.

While I love the TW Radar, it is produced to be of a general nature for all their clients.

For me I want to tweak it to the specific circumstances of one's company or clients.

Especially to create flexible types of Radars: Quadrants and sectors.

Pretty basic functionality, uses json and Protovis to generate SVG.

Data is provided in a radial format.

Eg. {name:'Cool Tech', r:50, t:30}
Appears in the Top Right Quadrant, in the inner most "Adopt" Sector.

Eg. {name:'Bright Shiny Toy 5', r:390, t:30}
Appears in the Top Right Quadrant, in the outer most "Hold" Sector.

Eg. {name:'Augmented Reality Tek', r:150, t:225}
Appears in the Lower Left Quadrant, in the second "Trial" Sector.

Where r = radius, and t = theta; the degrees in radians. with 0/360 degrees being the typical right hand x line rotating in an anti-clockwise direction.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinates for more details.
